## ü§ù Contribution

I contributed to both the backend and frontend of this project. On the backend, I was primarily responsible for developing the **complaint and user rating systems**, ensuring that the platform has a reliable and fair mechanism for resolving disputes and building trust. On the frontend, I developed the **lender component**, creating a user-friendly interface for managing books marked for lending.
